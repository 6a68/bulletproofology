## *bulletproofology, n. The study of bulletproof @font-face syntaxes*

### bulletproof? test it out for yourself.

It would be great to be able to **test** that different @font-face syntaxes really do, or really don't, work on certain browsers.

So I built this little express app, which serves up different syntaxes at different endpoints.

You can fire up some VMs and test yourself, or use a cross-browser screenshotting service to do it for you all automated-like.

### how to use?

    $ npm install bulletproofology
    $ npm start

### how to hack?

Apache 2 licensed. knock yourself out.
